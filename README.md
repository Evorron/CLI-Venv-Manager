# Simplified CLI-Venv-Manager
In Python, virtual environments are important as it acts as a lab for creating projects. Packages and Libraries can be installed and imported without any conflicts to those on the actual machine. As a beginner Python user utilising both IDEs and text editors via Linux, I often struggle to recall the commands and syntax to create a Python Venv and have to go through that process of search it up. As I progressed, I realised that I have created different Venv's in various paths and folders and that was becoming an issue in management. 

Hence, I've created this CLI Manager to do the following things:
* Create Python Virtual Environments
* Listing all Virtual Environments created (Checks all drives on the system)
* Search for a specific Virtual Environment based on name

## Getting Started
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.5 or higher: This versions of Python allows the recursive "os.walk()" method to use the os.scandir() method to search and list directories with a certain file and path.
* This script uses modules for the Python Standard Library. No other dependencies are required

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Evorron/CLI-Venv-Manager.git
```
## Usage

## Upcoming Features
* Text-based User Interface to substitute the CLI
